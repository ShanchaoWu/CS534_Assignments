Go to the `CS534_Assignments (your cloned repository)`, run

```bash

It may take long time if N is large. If you come across an issue that it takes long time with small N, please rerun the program.

#### A * Search

Run A*_and_Greedy_Haiyang.py. Type in the N as chessbord dimension.

If using Greedy Search: Change line 277 to : temp.cost_so_far=cal_f_greedy(temp.h_x,temp.g_x)

If using A* Search: Change line 277 to : temp.cost_so_far=cal_f_Astar(temp.h_x,temp.g_x)
